# Code Institute: mini-project

Hello and welcome to another mini-project with the Code Institute.

The focus of this project was to implement what I had just learnt about the role and importance of UX in my work. The unit included a discussion of the five planes of user centered design and why this approach is important to add value: to the user, to the developer and to the business owner.
This unit also focused on further preparation with key UXD skills before the first Milestone Project. 

The end result is a fictional CV page showcasing a set of skills and suitability for employment. 

The finished project can be found on the following link: https://mkthewlis.github.io/UCD-resume/
